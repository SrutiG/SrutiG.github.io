            My name is Sruti Guhathakurta and I was born in Tempe, Arizona.
            Some of my favorite things to do when I'm not coding are exploring Atlanta (especially the food scene),
            running, and spending time with my friends and family.

            My approach to the projects I work on is definitely influenced by my background. I've been to
            eight different schools growing up in different states and countries before I settled down at Georgia Tech in 2014.
            Because of this I enjoy surrounding myself with a diverse group of people and see value in everyone's opinions and
            ideas. I don't believe in leading or following, but rather working at the same level and appreciating everyone's unique
            contributions to whatever goal we're trying to accomplish. If you want to learn more about how I decided on CS,
            read my "Why I code" section below. Also, you can view my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> or
            some of these <a href="jsapps.html">random apps</a> I made for this website :).

        <h2>Why I code...</h2>
        <p>Ever since I switched to Computer Science on May 15, 2016 (I even remember the date)
            I can't stop coding. I'll sit down in the morning with a goal in mind, and before I know it, it's dark outside
            and I'm still trying to get the pesky margin between the navbar and the jumbotron to go away. Yet somehow coding
            is what I go to when I'm celebrating a tough week full of tests, going through a rough patch, or just chilling
            on a Saturday night. </p>

        <p>The first time I even considered Computer Science as a prospect was in fifth grade when I learned Scratch.
            I had an extremely active <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/HighSchoolMusical911/">Scratch profile</a>
            (I actually revisited it while writing this- "HighSchoolMusical911" haha) including games such as my rendering of pong, "Doggy Pong"
            and simpler things like a cat bouncing around the screen endlessly. After I retired
            my Scratch account, I encountered programming again in 7th
            grade when my dad gifted me a Java book. I made some simple functions like a tip calculator but I lost interest quickly
            and went back to playing Stunt Dirt Bike on Miniclip and watching TV.</p>

        <p>Throughout the rest of my school years, I didn't give Computer Science much thought. For some reason I thought it
            involved sitting hunched over at a computer for days in a dark room and writing lines and lines of code that rarely
            amounted to anything. I loved my math classes, however, and decided to attend Georgia Tech as an Industrial Engineering
            major.</p>

        <p>I liked Industrial Engineering but I always felt like there was something missing. The concepts I was learning were
            interesting but I wanted to be able to create things, not just analyze what was already there. I would always see that my friends
            in the College of Computing were so passionate about their major and eventually working for software companies that were dynamic and lively,
            nothing like the stereotype I had in mind. More than anything, I saw that they were creating their lives already, doing something bigger than
            just going to classes and retaining information. I didn't consider switching majors, however, because I didn't have much
            experience coding at the time.</p>

        <p>Then, I took a Data Input and Manipulation class where we learned so many concepts like web scraping, regular expressions, csv, and SQL. I started
            using the things I learned to help with my Industrial Engineering classes such as creating number generators for my simulation
            class. Over the breaks, I would do little projects using Python, and before I knew it, I realized that I really liked coding.</p>

        <p>At the end of the year, I finally made the switch to Computer Science and I couldn't be happier. Every day I get
            to work with my friends on projects I care a lot about and learn so many new skills at the same time. Most importantly,
            I feel like I have an opportunity to make a difference. Technology can help people in so many different ways whether
            it's connecting people to resources, giving people a platform to voice their opinions to a huge audience, or
            analyzing and interpreting data that can open so many doors. Now that I'm a part of this field, I can't wait to see what the future has in store.
